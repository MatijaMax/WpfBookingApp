# WpfBookingApp
A student project made in a team of 4. This is a desktop booking app with 4 types of users(Guest1, Guest2, Owner, Guide). My job was to develop functionalities and a GUI for the role of GUIDE. The project was developed in MVVM architecture with dependency injections and follows clean code principles. We also made 4 UML diagrams for the project (ActivityDiagram, ClassDiagram, SequenceDiagram, UseCaseDiagram). My Human-Computer Interaction task was to develop a GUI for a grandma that does not use a mouse, so I made shortcuts on almost all buttons and tweeked the GUI to work based on her abilities. The repo also contains a Balsamiq wireframe for my role and images of the app while it is running.
